### Project Description
A randomly backward-traveling dynamic game similar to snake and ladder game where the dice might advance, retreat, or randomly summon by a North Korean dictator to stop your journey.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt that games are too linear and boring ? We‚Äôre tackling the "unintuitive progression" crisis by bringing total chaos to the classic board game experience.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using a random backward dice roll, unexpected obstacles, intermittent Kim Jong-un "appearances" and some sound effect, we're solving non-problems with complex, interactive absurdity.
